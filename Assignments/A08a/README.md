## Assignment 8 - Public Key Encryption
#### Due: 11-10-2020 ( Tuesday @ 3:30 p.m.)

### Overview

This project will use an existing python library called [cryptography](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/index.html) (appropriately named) to use public key encryption to encrypt and decrypt messages sent between two entities. We need a method to allow two scripts to "talk" or communicate over a network. This means NOT on the same computer.  Using a library called Flask, we can do that. A Flask server runs and "listens" or monitors a "port" on a computer. When requests are directed to that port either from an internal request or an external request, they are handled by the process monitoring the port, or in our case Flask. 

A request can either ask for information (GET) or send information (POST). There are variations of requests that imply different actions, but we will get by with GET and POST for our project. Below you see a general picture of what is happening. 

There is a client/server on A and a client/server on B. Notice that the clients don't talk to their own servers! Why? They don't need to. Each process is local and can simply read or write from the local file system to communicate. However, each client does communicate with the server on the other machine.

Lets go through a scenario. No encryption, just sending a message:

- Client A wants to send a message to B.
- So Client A does a POST request sending a message to the server on B:
  
```python
m = "Hey Bud. You see that PSA about syphilis? Crazy right?!?"
p = requests.post('http://12.34.56.78:8080/message',json={"message":m})
```
- Server B receives the message and writes the message to a file in the file system. 
- Client B is "watching" the file for changes, and when it does change, they read the file (message)


Is this the best way to implement this? Nah. Probably a few better ways (aka sockets). Is this the easiest for us? You bet!

- pip install flask
- pip install requests
- pip install watchdog
