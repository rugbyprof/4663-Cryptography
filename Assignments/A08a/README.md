## Assignment 8 - Public Key Encryption
#### Due: 11-10-2020 ( Tuesday @ 3:30 p.m.)

### Overview

This project will use an existing python library called [cryptography](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/index.html) (appropriately named) to use public key encryption to encrypt and decrypt messages sent between two entities. We need a method to allow two individuals to "talk" or communicate over a network. This means NOT on the same computer.  

A request can either ask for information (GET) or send information (POST). There are variations of requests that imply different actions, but we will get by with GET and POST for our project. Below you see a general picture of what is happening.
